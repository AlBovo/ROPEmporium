# ROP Emporium ‚öôÔ∏è

> [`ROP Emporium`](https://ropemporium.com/) is an online platform designed around the concept of ROP (Return-Oriented Programming)üíª, a security technique often used in the field of cybersecurity. In this context, Rop Emporium serves as an educational resource and challenge platform for those looking to deepen their understanding of exploiting vulnerabilities through ROP. It provides users with various exercises that simulate real-world scenarios where attackers leverage ROP to bypass security mechanisms such as data execution prevention (DEP) and address space layout randomization (ASLR). The platform offers hands-on experience for security researchers, students, and professionals in the field of ethical hacking, allowing them to practice and refine their exploitation skills in a controlled environment.

In this repository, I've uploaded all the exploits üêç I've used to capture the flag üö© in a local context.

## Usage ‚ö°
All the exploits should follow these guidelines regarding the debugging of the exploit and its execution.
```
python3 exploit.py <DEBUG>
```
If the **`DEBUG`** argument is passed to the exploit, it will spawn a *GDB* shell, hosting a GDB Server using the **KGX** terminal.
